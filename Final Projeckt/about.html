            <h2>History of Guitar</h2>
                    <img src="img/g1.png" alt="">
                        <p>The guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is usually fretted (with some exceptions) and typically has
                            six or twelve strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking 
                            the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers
                            of the opposite hand. A guitar pick may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, 
                            by means of a resonant hollow chamber on the guitar, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier. <br>
                            The guitar is classified as a chordophone, meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between
                             two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood, with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar 
                             strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States,[1] but nylon and steel strings
                              became mainstream only following World War II.[1] The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the 
                              four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development 
                              of the modern six-string instrument.
                             electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the
                              flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar"
                              . The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, 
                              which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a
                               comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to
                                being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and 
                                country guitar playing in the United States.
